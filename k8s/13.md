Each pod has its own `visits.txt` file. Different web requests were served by different replicas, therefore each pod has its unique records in the `visits.txt` file.

Ordering guarantee is not necessary for the app because all pods are functionally the same. It does not matter to the end user, which one launches or terminates first (in fact, the end user might not be even aware about the scaling itself). Pods are completely replaceble by one another.
