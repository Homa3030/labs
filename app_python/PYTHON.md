## Framework

Flask is both easy and allow to create a variety of applications for certain platforms.

### Pros:
- Easy to understand development
- It is very flexible and easy

# Unit Tests

The tests are located in the `test.py` file. They cover the logic of the Flask app. That is:

- setting the correct timezone;

- Tests should be independent from each other.
- Tests should run fast.
